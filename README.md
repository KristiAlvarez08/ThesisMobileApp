# Motorcycle Engine Immobilizer using App Generated Key
  This contains the source code of our mobile application named CAMMA that stands for "Canada,Alvarez,Malabay,Mendola,Agrabio" which are also the members of our thesis group.

# Abstract
  As time passes, the number of vehicles grow larger because of economic growth. This also causes an increase in vehicle theft. Because of their lightweight and easy maneuverability, motorcycles are often the target of thieves. Over the years, many mechanical and electronic security measures have been made for motorcycles such as steering locks, brake locks, and alarms. These measures are still not enough to discourage thieves since motorcycle theft cases still continue to grow. This study aims to develop a code dependent engine immobilizer for motorcycles. The proposed system utilizes a mobile application which would be responsible for changing the key code of the immobilizer, the immobilizer would then sync with a fob to have matching key codes. The key code being transmitted would be encrypted to protect it from sniffing attacks. For the engine to be enabled, the key code of the fob must match with that of the immobilizer.
